Hi there!


I'm Uswa, a passionate junior Angular Developer, (with 1yr of experience in) designing Dynamic Single-Page applications using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, Angular Material, Angular 2+, & TypeScript (with Deployment), and could also develop Static Landing-Pages using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5 (including JavaScript & Deployment).

I'm currently learning the Backend (Full Stack Development (MEAN), which will end in Oct -2022), and learning some more about Angular 2+ (from Udemy), as it doesn't require a database or a server, and a web application made with it could be easily deployed on Vercel. 

To boost my experience, I'm looking for an internship in Front-end or Angular development.


Thank you for checking out my LinkedIn profile. I hope you have a great day!

Best regards,


Uswa R.
